  <p>
    I am a 3rd Yr student doing Btech in Computer Science from MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women,Pune.
    Engineering was never my first option but i guess u got to handle what life throws at you,so here i am coding and stuff.
    I love exploring new things, thus i do not like to settle down to one part of CS or one language.
    From past 2 years with te help of my college curricullum i've always tried to know about different areas in CS like python,java
    then i got bored of coding alltogether so started learning web development which has now lead to quite a few certifications in my name.
